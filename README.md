# Constellations

Python program that reads in a file of stars and stores them into a dictionary with the key being the star and the value is the coordinates. Uses turtle to draw the stars by using their coordinates to place them and then reads in a file of constellations which contains the name of star pairings that connect with each other to form the constellation and draws it onto the display.
